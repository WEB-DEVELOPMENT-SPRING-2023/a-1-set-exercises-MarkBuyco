    <p>The story is about Loki escaping the events of Avenger:Endgame into another timeline, in which
        Loki was then captured by the TVA(Time Variance Authority). The TVA is an organization that
        takes place outside time and space, who monitors the proper flow of the sacred timeline. Loki
        questions his reality of being a god of mischief, as he was introduced into a world wherein 
        everything he believe in was an orchestrated storyline. This series also showcases different
        variants of loki from different timelines, like Sylvie, (A woman variant of loki) which the TVA
        is hunting.
