    <H2 id="reviews">Reviews</H2>
    <p>The centrality of the romance in Loki makes it stand out within the MCU-and signals how much 
        potential there is in this kind of storytelling, should Marvel choose to mine it.
        -Alison Herman
    </p>

    <p>Hiddleston's performance as Loki has always been defined by its humour as much as its pathos.
         Both seem to be on display in equal measure in Loki. -Michael Idato
    </p>

    <p>Without a doubt, the visuals on this show far surpass not only the other Disney+ shows, 
        but actually a lot of Marvel's films as well. The visual effects, cinematography and the 
        set pieces were incredible, I would even say iconic. -Joseph Garcia
   </p>

   <p>Tom Hiddleston once again proves why Loki remains the MCU's standout villain, while also 
    holding together a truly masterful multiverse story that hits upon themes of identity 
    and agency that have always felt core to the character. -Jessie Gender
